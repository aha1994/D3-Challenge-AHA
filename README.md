# D3-Challenge-AHA
Exploring D3.js. Built a simple page that displays a single scatter plot displaying obesity rate and income. Uses D3.js to create the chart, display the state on each scatter point, and to scale the page on a resize of the window. Hosted at https://aha1994.github.io/D3-Challenge-AHA/
